# Bluetooth Controlled 4-Wheeld Robot
## Introduction

Welcome to the Bluetooth Controlled 4-Wheel Robot project! This repository contains the source code and documentation for building a robot that can be controlled via Bluetooth using a mobile device.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Control:** Use your smartphone or tablet to wirelessly control the robot.
- **4-Wheel Drive:** The robot is equipped with four wheels for better stability and maneuverability.
- **Customizable:** The code is open-source, allowing you to modify and enhance the robot's functionality.
- **Easy to Build:** Follow the step-by-step instructions to assemble your own robot.

## Getting Started
